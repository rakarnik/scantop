Usage:
`scantop <ace_file> <motif_number> <sequence_file> <background_file> <site_count> <output_file>`
- ace_file: AlignACE output file with motifs
- motif_number:	Motif number within ace_file to use
- sequence_file: File with sequences to scan (FASTA format)
- background_file: File with sequences used to build background model (FASTA format)
- site_count: Number of top scoring instances to output per sequence
